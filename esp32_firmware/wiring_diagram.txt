- Motor + -> ESC2 Motor +
- Motor - -> ESC2 Motor -

Power Supply:
=============

ESP32 Power:
- 5V pin -> 5V+ (from power supply)
- GND pin -> GND (from power supply)

ESC Power:
- ESC1 VCC -> 5V+ (from power supply)
- ESC1 GND -> GND (from power supply)
- ESC2 VCC -> 5V+ (from power supply)
- ESC2 GND -> GND (from power supply)

Optional Components:
===================

Status LED:
- Anode (+) -> GPIO 2
- Cathode (-) -> GND
- Resistor: 220Ω (between GPIO 2 and LED anode)

Emergency Stop Button:
- One terminal -> GPIO 0
- Other terminal -> GND
- Internal pull-up resistor enabled in firmware

Power Requirements:
===================

ESP32:
- Voltage: 5V
- Current: ~500mA (without WiFi)
- Current: ~1A (with WiFi)

ESCs:
- Voltage: Depends on motor requirements (typically 6V-12V)
- Current: Depends on motor specifications
- Check ESC and motor datasheets for exact requirements

Motors:
- Voltage: Depends on motor specifications
- Current: Depends on motor specifications
- Check motor datasheets for exact requirements

Safety Notes:
=============

1. Always disconnect power before making connections
2. Double-check all connections before powering on
3. Start with low speeds for testing
4. Ensure proper ESC calibration
5. Use appropriate fuses/circuit breakers
6. Monitor motor temperature during operation
7. Keep emergency stop accessible
8. Test with motors unloaded first

Troubleshooting:
===============

No Movement:
- Check power connections
- Verify ESC calibration
- Check motor connections
- Ensure firmware is uploaded correctly

Erratic Movement:
- Check for loose connections
- Verify ESC calibration
- Check power supply stability
- Reduce speed values

Communication Issues:
- Check USB cable connection
- Verify serial port permissions
- Check baud rate settings
- Restart ESP32

ESC Beeping:
- Normal during startup
- Continuous beeping = calibration issue
- Intermittent beeping = power issue
